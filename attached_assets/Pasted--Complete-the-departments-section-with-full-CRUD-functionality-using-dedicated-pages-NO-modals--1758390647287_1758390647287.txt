"Complete the departments section with full CRUD functionality using dedicated pages (NO modals):

CURRENT STATE:
- Database schema exists with hierarchy support (parentId, managerId)
- Basic GET/POST API routes exist
- Department listing page shows cards with name/description
- Buttons exist but don't function (Add, Edit, View, Delete)

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

1. ADD NEW DEPARTMENT PAGE (/hr/departments/new):
- Full page form with fields: Department Name, Description, Parent Department (dropdown), Manager (dropdown from employees)
- Validation for required fields
- Save/Cancel buttons with proper navigation
- Success redirect to departments list

2. EDIT DEPARTMENT PAGE (/hr/departments/[id]/edit):
- Full page form pre-populated with current department data
- Same fields as add page: name, description, parent department, manager
- Save/Cancel buttons with navigation back to department details or list
- PUT API endpoint for updates

3. VIEW DEPARTMENT DETAILS PAGE (/hr/departments/[id]):
- Dedicated page showing full department information
- Real employee count (query employees table by department_id)
- List/table of employees in this department
- Manager information display
- Child departments section (if any)
- Action buttons: Edit, Delete, Assign Employees

4. DELETE DEPARTMENT:
- Confirmation notification/toast (only modals allowed)
- Check if department has employees or child departments
- Option to reassign employees before deletion via separate page
- DELETE API endpoint with proper validation

5. EMPLOYEE ASSIGNMENT PAGE (/hr/departments/[id]/employees):
- Dedicated page for managing department employees
- Two sections: Current employees + Available employees
- Transfer interface to move employees between departments
- Bulk selection for multiple employee transfers

6. DEPARTMENT HIERARCHY PAGE (/hr/departments/hierarchy):
- Separate page showing tree view of all departments
- Expandable/collapsible department structure
- Visual indicators for hierarchy levels
- Links to individual department detail pages

7. ROUTING STRUCTURE:
- /hr/departments (main list page)
- /hr/departments/new (add new department)
- /hr/departments/hierarchy (tree view)
- /hr/departments/[id] (view department details)
- /hr/departments/[id]/edit (edit department)
- /hr/departments/[id]/employees (manage employees)

8. ENHANCED FEATURES:
- Real employee counts on department cards
- Search and filtering on main departments page
- Manager assignment via dropdown on add/edit pages
- Success/error notifications (not modals)
- Loading states for all pages
- Breadcrumb navigation between pages

BUILD IN THIS ORDER:
1. Add New Department page
2. View Department Details page (with real data)
3. Edit Department page
4. Employee Assignment page
5. Department Hierarchy page
6. Delete functionality with confirmations
7. Search and filtering on main page

All interactions should use dedicated pages with proper navigation and HR sidebar context."
